Groups can be created by clicking the ![](/src/main/resources/add_group_icon.png) icon at the top. Groups will track their own progress but will also contribute to the total progress for all items. Groups can be deleted by right clicking the group and selecting 'Delete Group'. This will not delete the items within them. Items can be removed from the group individually by clicking the ![](/src/main/resources/delete_icon.png) icon next to them.

### Sorting

Items can be automatically sorted by using the ![](/src/main/resources/sort_icon.png) icon in the top right. Items can be sorted by price either ascending or descening. The sort icon will only appear as long as items exist in the list.

Items can be manually moved throughout the list by using the ![](/src/main/resources/shift_up_icon.png) or ![](/src/main/resources/shift_down_icon.png) icons.
