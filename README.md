Items will be tracked using the bank value you configured alongside Grand Exchange prices. Your bank value will be updated anytime you visit the bank. The item prices will be updated every 5 minutes.

### Sorting

Items can be automatically sorted by using the ![](/src/main/resources/sort_icon.png) icon in the top right. Items can be sorted by price either ascending or descening. The sort icon will only appear as long as items exist in the list.

Items can be manually moved throughout the list by using the ![](/src/main/resources/shift_up_icon.png) or ![](/src/main/resources/shift_down_icon.png) icons.
